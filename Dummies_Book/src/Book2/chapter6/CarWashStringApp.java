//ar wash program that uses the
//string codes PRESIDENTIAL, ELITE, DELUXE, SUPER, and STANDARD as the car wash
//types, instead of the letters A through E. Notice that to allow for variations in how
//a user might capitalize these codes, the userâ€™s input is converted to all capital
//letters before it is tested against the string constants in the switch statement

//PRESIDENTIAL
//STANDARD
//SUPER
//ELITE
//DELUXE
