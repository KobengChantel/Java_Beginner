//Creating Generic Class

//ArrayList or a LinkedList so the compiler can prevent you from accidentally
//adding the wrong type of data to the collection. The ArrayList and LinkedList
//classes can do this because they take advantage of a feature called generics.

//why generic
//enerics let you create classes that can be used for any type specified by the pro-
//grammer at compile time. To accomplish that, the Java designers introduced a
//new feature to the language, called formal type parameters. To create a class that
//uses a formal type parameter, you list the type parameter after the class name
//in angle bracket
//
