//Using Bulk Data
//Operations with
//Collections
//


//one of the most common things to do with a collection is to iterate over it,
//performing some type of operation on all of its elements.
//you can use a feature called bulk data operations thatâ€™s designed
//specifically to attack this very problem. When you use bulk data operations, you
//do not directly iterate over the collection data using a foreach loop.
