//Cloning refers to the process of making an exact duplicate of an object
//is process turns out to be a pretty difficult task in an object-oriented
//language such as Java
//By contrast, a clone is an altogether new object that has the same values as the
//original object

//he clone method is defined by the Object class, so itâ€™s available to all Java
//classes, but clone is declared with protected access in the Object class. As a
//result, the clone method for a given class is available only within that class

//a simple example of a program that clones Employee objects.
//In a nutshell, this program overrides the clone method for the Employee class: It
//creates an Employee object, clones it, changes the name of the original Employee
//object, and prints out both objects to the console.
