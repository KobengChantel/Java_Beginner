//To create
//a class instance, you have to have at least one public constructor. If you donâ€™t pro-
//vide a constructor in your class, Java automatically inserts a default constructor,
//which happens to be public


//    All you have to do to prevent a class instance from being created, then, is provide
//            a single private constructor, like this:
    public class Validation
    {
        private Validation() {} // prevents instances
// static methods and fields go here
    }
