//ext thing to do is write a short class that uses these two Player classes to
//play a game. This class contains a method named playTheGame that accepts two
//Player objects. It calls the move method of the first player and then calls the move
//method of the second player
//playTheGame method doesnâ€™t know which of the two players is the
//basic player and which is the better player. It simply calls the move method for
//each Player object
